# Guessing_Author_Name_Using_Naive_Bayes_in_Python
# Objective:
Training Machine Learning Algorithm on the feature set of different books of two authors and testing it by other features of unknown author to find out who wrote it.
# Discussion: 
Getting five bodies of text from two authors, total of ten documents to analyze. First we will be constructing a feature matrix with a minimum of ten features. We will include POS as part of this feature matrix. Additionally, we will include tags for the instance of that particular body of text, this is our Y vector which is composed of 0s and 1s to designate the author for the book, then we need to assess a Naive Bayes machine learning model utilizing the ten instances for modeling the particular author of the books. Remember, we are shuffling the training/test set. We are using 7 for training and 3 for testing our model. 
# Results:
 we are getting the results in terms of accuracy. 
Post Attempts: Trying 3 shuffles of our instances(feature matrix rows) and run each through the Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm. Reporting each individualâ€™s accuracy and the average accuracy for all three tests.
